# osu-pps - osu! farm maps

A [website made by grumd](https://osu-pps.com) with a list of most farmy maps in osu!.  
Supports osu!std, taiko, mania, fruits.

# Setup

You should have nodejs and npm installed first. I'm using node v8.9.  
For initial setup, `npm i` in the root directory and in `/react-app` if you want to run front-end.  
To run update scripts, you also need to create a `/update-scripts/config.json` file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "apikey": "<your-osu-api-key>"
}
```

### Front-end
Open `/ui` and run `npm start`.

For debugging, you can change `VITE_LOCAL_FETCH` env variable in `/ui/.env` - front-end will search for json data files in `/react-app/public` instead of fething json from github.

### Back-end (json update scripts)
Open `/update-scripts` and run `node scheduler.js`.

For debugging, you can change `DEBUG` variable in `/update-scripts/constants.js` - limits update process to just a few users/maps for debugging and testing purposes.

# Contributing

I didn't intend for this repository to have contributions, it's mostly here for my own convenience. The code is pretty messy and hard to understand.

But if you still want to contribute, you can create a merge request based on `develop` branch.
`master` branch shouldn't be touched, it's used for data updates and is force-pushed regularly.
